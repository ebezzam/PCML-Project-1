# PCML Project 1

MATLAB code and report for [Project 1](http://icapeople.epfl.ch/mekhan/pcml15/project-1/index.html) of the [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course](http://icapeople.epfl.ch/mekhan/pcml15.html) at EPFL. The goal of the project was to investigate regression and classification.

## Training/Comparing Models

* Run `code/compareRegModels.m` for regression training data
* Run `code/compareClassModels.m` for classification training data


## Computing Predictions

* Run `computeRegPrediction.m` to compute predictions for regression test data
* Run `computeClassPrediction.m` to compute predictions for classification test data
